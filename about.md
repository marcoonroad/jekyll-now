### About this blog

Frequently (if God gives me the precious time), Type Theory stuff, Functional things, Compiler engineering, Computation
models, Concurrency features, Prototype-based discussion and Forth-like related posts will arise here.

### About me

A newcomer in the constantly evolving (although not always) Computer Science field who is grateful for also being lazy.
