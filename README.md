My own blog about Computer Science related posts. (https://marcoonroad.dev)

Topics, fields, features and theories that I want to cover are:
* Object-orientation, either Class-based or Prototype-based
* Type theory & type systems, including polymorphism, abstraction, effects and ownership
* Functional programming, almost something else that you will not find easily in the web
* Concurrency, mostly the Actor model, Reactive programming, CSP and Promises/futures
* Concatenative programming, 'cause it's _the paradigm of the future_, easily reversible
* Machine Learning & AI, when I find some time to study these increasing popularity topics
* Software engineering, the super-structure of OOP Class-based
* Language design & Compiler engineering, but only when I grasp some background enough for that
